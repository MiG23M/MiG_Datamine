Notice of Amendments to Gaijin Terms and Conditions

We have changed certain Terms and Conditions https://legal.gaijin.net/ that govern your relationship with Gaijin. These changes take place automatically on the corresponding effective dates indicated in the Terms and Conditions https://legal.gaijin.net/ and completely replace any prior version of these Terms and Conditions to which you have agreed.

Please carefully review this notice and familiarize yourself with the changes at legal.gaijin.net.

By continuing to use our services after the changes take effect, you automatically agree to be bound by those changes. No further action is needed from you to accept such changes.

Most of the changes to our documents are immaterial and have the purpose to make our rules more straightforward, understandable, and transparent.

Here is a brief summary of the major changes and updates:

* Privacy Policy https://legal.gaijin.net/privacypolicy and special Community Rules for live.warthunder.com have been significantly revised and supplemented.
* New policies and rules have been introduced: 
* Trade Policy https://legal.gaijin.net/tradepolicy; 
* WT Live Copyright Compliance Policy https://legal.gaijin.net/wt-compliance-policy.
* All in-game items are attached to a specific platform (Windows, Xbox, PlayStation, iOS, Android, etc.) where they are purchased and activated. It is impossible to transfer in-game items between different platforms. Therefore, in-game items purchased from one platform are not displayed and cannot be used when switching platforms.
* The guarantees and consumer rights that apply to in-game items for Australian residents under the Australian Consumer Law have been added to the Store Policy.
* More detailed provisions on jurisdiction and dispute resolution methods for users from different countries, such as the US, Canada, and Australia, have been added. In addition, the new version of the Terms of Service includes conditions for mandatory pre-dispute arbitration and a 60-day advance notice requirement.
* The concept of “user-generated content” has been clarified, and payouts for specific types of user-generated content have been specified in the Contribution Agreement.
* User accounts inactive for 5 (five) or more years may be deleted together with in-game currencies, purchases, and data. This is required to comply with data protection laws and maintain an active user base. 
* All the rules of conduct for Gaijin games are now put in one document for easier comprehension. Certain Gaijin games may have their own set of specific rules, which you will need to follow along with the general rules. Please remember, if you are playing any Gaijin game, it is important to follow both sets of rules.
* New naming rules have been introduced to ensure comfortable and friendly gameplay for all our users from around the world, including the rules about nicknames, clan names and profile descriptions.
