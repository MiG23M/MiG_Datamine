However, we do share data in very limited cases with our partners, service providers, and affiliates, including those located outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

4.1. With whom we share data

Gaming platforms. We share your data with our business partners involved in Games distribution to enable access to our Services from those platforms and to enable user support and all the features related to our Services for those users who are playing our Games through gaming platforms. Some of these partners are located outside the EEA. For example, these are Microsoft operating Xbox, Nintendo with Nintendo Switch, and Sony operating PlayStation. 

Payment services providers. We are engaging authorized payment services providers to process payments for our Services. Depending on your region, your data might be shared with those payment service providers who are licensed and operate in the respective region and country.

Anti-cheat systems. We may monitor your activities while using the Services and analyze the devices and software you are using to ensure your following Gaijin Terms of Services and EULA, including prevention of cheating and fraud in our Games, and monitoring toxicity.

Advertising partners. From time to time, we engage advertising partners to assist us with their tracking and analytical tools. For example, we may share anonymized information on your device, location and purchases, and use of the Services. In some cases, their third-party partners may enhance these data with the information they already have, including the data about you.

Operating partners. We are engaging server hosting providers to store the data necessary to provide our Services online.

Service providers. We may share data with our third-party services providers, for example, software developers or administrative services providers.

Affiliates. We may share personal data with companies within the Gaijin group and affiliated entities. 

Auditors. When an audit or financial reporting obligation is imposed on us by applicable law, we share data with third parties to comply with these obligations. We are carefully assessing each case and sharing the narrowest scope of data possible.

Governmental bodies. We share data with governmental bodies, directly or through our partners, when it is prescribed by applicable law, legally requested by authorized bodies, or otherwise necessary to protect the rights or interests of our users or our own. We carefully assess each case and share the narrowest possible data.

Gaijin users. Other users of our Services may see some of your data when some Services features allow so. For example, your nickname, avatar (profile photo), and the data of your linked accounts (including Steam, PSN, and Apple Game Center accounts) are visible to other players. They can also see any content you post publicly within our Services and social networks (public messages on forums, attached files, etc.), or some of your game results (data of in-game ratings or leaderboards) and achievements.

Additionally, we may ask for your specific consent to share your personal data with other third parties. In this case, we will specify those third parties, the scope of data to be shared, purposes, and further details on relevant data processing.

4.2. Transferring your data abroad

We operate all over the world, and therefore we may transfer your data to third parties in different countries, including those which are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). We make all our efforts, including those imposed on us by applicable law, to ensure an adequate level of personal data protection in each case. Some countries to which we transfer your data may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. 

However, in such cases, we are taking reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any personal information provide sufficient protection of your data. In particular, Gaijin undertakes appropriate physical, technical, and administrative security measures to ensure your data is adequately protected.

5. HOW LONG WE PROCESS YOUR DATA

We process your data for as long as our processing purposes, the legal retention periods, and our legitimate interests require it, or storage is a technical necessity.

We keep your personal data for as long as it is required considering our processing purposes (including while your Gaijin Account is active according to the Terms and Conditions) and our legitimate interests, regulatory or technical requirements regarding data storage. If there are no contrary legal or contractual obligations, we will delete or anonymize your data once the storage or processing period has expired.

Please consider that we have the right to continue to retain some of your user data even after complying with your request to delete such data in the following cases:
	* we have the lawful basis to further processing your data other than consent from you (for instance, we may be required to do so to comply with applicable laws, such as tax or accounting regulations, know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, or other legal requirements and obligations);
	* your user data has been anonymized in a way it cannot be used to identify you and therefore is no longer your personal identifiable data.

6. CHILDREN’S DATA

We acknowledge the importance of protecting children’s data and confirm our special duty to act accordingly. Thus, we take additional steps to verify the user’s age and limit access to our Services for those who have not reached the appropriate age limit.

We do not intentionally collect, store or otherwise process any personal data of users under the age of 16 unless we are furnished with consent from their parent, guardian, or another holder of parental responsibility.

If you are a parent, guardian, or another holder of parental responsibility, and you want to withdraw your previously given consent, or you find out that your child has provided us with their personal data without your consent, or you believe that we have unintentionally collected your child’s data and processed such data in violation of applicable law, please send us a request for the removal of such data by contacting Gaijin Support. To proceed with such a request, we may ask you to provide us with conclusive evidence that:
	* the child has not yet reached 16 or the minimum age of consent in accordance with their applicable legislation, and
	* you are the holder of parental responsibility for such a child.

If it comes that we have unintentionally collected personal data of a child under 16 (or a child who has not reached the age of consent in accordance with applicable law) without the consent of that child’s holder of parental responsibility, we will take all reasonable steps to erase this information as soon as possible, unless we are legally obliged to keep these data.

We strongly encourage parents, legal guardians, or other holders of parental responsibility to instruct their children never to disclose their real names, addresses, phone numbers, financial information, or any other sensitive data about themselves when using our services, in-game chats, on the websites (forums, commentaries, etc.) and otherwise on the Internet.

7. HOW WE SECURE DATA

We are constantly working on the creation, improvement, and further implementation of both administrative and technical measures for securing your data. These measures are aimed at protecting your data from any unauthorized actions that can be carried out by third parties or occur incidentally, such as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, or other malicious use of your data, as well as incidental loss or corruption of such data. We undertake all reasonable steps and measures which are necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Please consider that we maintain some of our servers where we store information containing your data outside the EEA.

8. AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND ONLINE TRACKING

Gaijin itself does not use your data for profiling or other means of automated decision-making that could affect you, including your access to the services or other rights under the Terms and Conditions.

At the same time, some of our partners, as described in Section 4 (How We Share Data), may apply automated decision-making while processing the data we share with them (for example, for anti-cheat and unfair play prevention purposes).

We use various techniques on our websites that allow us, and third parties engaged by us, to recognize you during your use of our website and possibly to track you through several visits. This data is essentially used to enhance and personalize your experience with our websites. This works in such a way that our systems or systems of our partners recognize you (by sending so-called “cookies” to your browser for further identification) when you are entering any Gaijin website, and tailor the website settings and content to your preferences and previous experience.

9. WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE

9.1. What right related to your personal data you have

You have the following rights in relation to our data processing, depending on the applicable data protection laws.

Right to be informed. You have the right to be informed about how we collect and use personal data.

Right to access. You have the right to request us to show what data we are holding on you and provide you with a copy of those.

Right to rectification. You have the right to request us to correct your personal data if it is inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, incorrect, unlawfully received, or no longer relevant for the purpose of processing.

Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”). You can request Gaijin to erase any of your data unless we have to continue processing some of your personal information under applicable law.

Right to data portability. You have the right to ask to provide your data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format or to request Gaijin to directly transmit those data to a third party where it is technically possible and reasonable.

Right to restrict processing. You have the right to restrict the use of your data in certain circumstances entirely or in part unless we have to continue processing some of your personal information under applicable law.

Right to withdraw consent. Where your data are processed based on your freely given consent, you have the right to withdraw your previously given consent at any time.

Right to object. You have the right to object to processing your personal data at any time. 

Right to object automated processing. Where data processing based exclusively on automated decision-making or profiling takes place, you have the right to object to such processing. 

9.2. How to exercise your rights

If you want to exercise any of these rights with respect to Gaijin processing your personal data, please submit your request to Gaijin Support after signing in to your Gaijin Account. We ask you to sign in with your Gaijin Account to ensure that it is you and to limit cases where third parties have access to your personal data or in any way affect processing your personal data and exercising your data subject rights.

It might happen that you have lost access to your Gaijin Account. In this case, you are still welcome to exercise your rights. When receiving your unidentified request to Gaijin Support, we may ask for your security data for your identification to restore access to your Gaijin Account. Usually, these are questions referring to your account and Game data, which are reasonably known only to you.

You also have the above-mentioned data subject rights regarding personal data processed by our partners as independent controllers. You may contact those partners to exercise your rights.

9.3. Data erasure

If you decided to erase the data that we have on you, we would delete your data where it is possible considering other users and our obligations to store data under applicable law.

Please note that data erasure would lead to complete irrevocable deletion of your Gaijin Account. This means that, after the deletion, you will be unable to restore your game progress, acquired in-game assets, and currencies.

We will first suspend an account while eliciting all the personal data that we have on you. This means that you will not have access to our Services. As a rule, we delete personal data in 30 days. However, if we need some more time to consider technical issues and the complexity of the request, we will anyway complete the erasure request within 2 months.

If you decide to restore the account after submitting your data erasure request, you may send us a request through Gaijin Support within 30 days after you suspended your account. We will restore your Gaijin Account and let you know if the deletion process still needs to be completed. Otherwise, we will permanently delete your account and your personal data after the expiration of this suspension period.

10. HOW TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT

You can withdraw your consent to process your data under this Privacy Policy at any time by initiating the deletion of your Gaijin Account through your account settings and following the instructions provided by Gaijin after you send such a deletion request. 

If you wish to withdraw your consent in respect of a particular processing purpose, please contact us at Gaijin Support Portal. However, we reserve the right to cease providing you the services if your withdrawal is not consistent with providing services in the manner prescribed by the Terms and Conditions. Please note that such withdrawal does not impact the validity of the consent before withdrawal, and we reserve the right to process your data on another lawful basis if permitted by applicable law.

Please also note that uninstalling our game (or any application related to our services) from your device does not automatically result in consent withdrawal or deleting your personal data from our servers.

To accelerate the response to your request, please provide Gaijin's representatives with all the information they need to solve the problem in a reasonable time.

9.1 Gaijin may provide the User with a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable right to use test versions of Services to identify errors and help improve their functionality.

The User also must not publish or transfer to third parties screenshots of the Services, screen recordings containing closed Services, information about errors found in the Service, stream gameplay (or any other use of Services) in real-time, as well as perform other actions to disclose any information about the Services. This confidentiality statement is valid indefinitely or for the longest possible period permitted by applicable law if indefinite validity is not permitted.

9.4. Test versions of the Services may become unavailable at any time at Gaijin’s discretion, as well as the User’s progress, achievements, in-game items, and other data.

10. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 The Services are used at the User’s own risk and with the agreement that the User will be solely responsible for any damage to the User's device, loss of data, or other harm that results from such activities. Gaijin does NOT make any warranties in respect to the Services unless otherwise expressly specified in these Terms and Conditions, including, without limitation, Services being accessible, risk-free, fit for a particular purpose, error-free and suitable, and unharmful for User's health and well-being.

10.2. The User will indemnify and keep indemnified Gaijin and its agents, employees, directors, successors, assignees, and licensees from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and damages (including legal fees and expenses) arising directly or indirectly in connection with or related to User's conduct or violation of the Terms and Conditions (including these Terms).

10.3 In no event shall Gaijin or any of its affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, punitive, special, or incidental damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business, contract, revenue, data, information, or business interruption), under any theory of liability, resulting from, arising out of or in connection with the use of or inability to use the Services or the content, products, service, the statements or actions of any third party on or through the Services, any unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmission or data, any information that is sent or received, or not sent or received, any failure to store data, any loss of data, loss or damage to files, content, and/or any Services available, even if Gaijin has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation shall not apply to liability for a death or a personal injury to the extent the applicable law prohibits such limitation. Furthermore, as some jurisdictions do not allow or limit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages or do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, the above limitation may not apply in particular circumstances.

11.1 The Terms and Conditions (including these Terms) are legally binding upon all Users and constitute a written agreement between the User and Gaijin.

11.2 The Terms and Conditions (including these Terms) may be updated and changed from time to time.

If the User continues to use the Services after a change or update, this constitutes the User’s acceptance of the amended Terms and Conditions.

11.5 The provisions of the Terms and Conditions (or any of their integral part) are severable, and invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remainder of the Terms and Conditions. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, this shall not affect any other provision, and the Terms and Conditions shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision was not a part of the Terms and Conditions that shall be carried out as nearly as possible in accordance with the original terms and intent.

12.1 The Terms and Conditions (including these Terms) and any claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with them are governed by the laws of the Republic of Cyprus, except for the cases below.
	* For residents in the USA and Canada, any dispute arising out of or related to the Terms and Conditions (including these Terms) shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict of law provisions (especially, the United States Federal Arbitration Act regulating interpretation and enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate and no class actions provisions).

Arbitration in such case shall be initiated in the Out-of-court Dispute Settlement Body for Consumers and Entrepreneurs e.V. (Außergerichtliche Streitbeilegungsstelle für Verbraucher und Unternehmer e.V.) in Germany (Hohe Straße 11, 04107 Leipzig), which decision shall be binding, subject to the procedure prescribed by the Regulation on consumer Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), as stipulated by EU Regulation No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC, as of the date of commencement of a dispute (more information at: www.ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).

But if there is a conflict between these Terms and Conditions (including these Terms) and AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms. The arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, State of California, USA. You and Gaijin agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court to compel arbitration, to stay the proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English. You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly forfeiting your right to a trial by jury and to otherwise proceed in a lawsuit in state or federal court. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on you and Gaijin and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

To prevent unauthorized use of the Game, Gaijin may utilize specific technical means (DRM tools, anti-cheat solutions, etc.) designed to prevent such unauthorized use of our Games and our intellectual property and other rights. For example, Gaijin utilizes Easy Anti-Cheat for that purpose (for more information, please visit Easy Anti-Cheat official website, available at www.easy.ac).

5. DEMO ACCESS

From time to time, Gaijin may provide certain Users of Gaijin’s choice access to a particular Game or to a Gaijin Account intended solely for launching and playing the Game for a short time specified by Gaijin and typically without charging any fee for such access (the “Demo Access”). However, Gaijin does not guarantee to Demo Access holders the safety of their game progress, In-Game Items, or the possibility of transferring their Demo Account data to their personal Gaijin Account.

6. IN-GAME ITEMS AND APPLICABLE FEES

6.1. Gaijin’s Games are usually distributed on a free basis (unless otherwise explicitly stated by Gaijin or its distribution partners). Regardless of the distribution basis (paid, free, or otherwise), Gaijin usually offers for “real world” money the right to use the optional in-game data indented to extend or improve your gameplay and in-game experience, such as in-game virtual currency (for which you can buy other In-Game Items), DLCs, characters and virtual objects (vehicles, weapons, mounts, military equipment, etc.), as well as skins for them, any consumables and other items/features modifying your gameplay and enhancing your in-game experience (collectively, “In-Game Items”). Such In-Game Items constitute an integral part of the relevant Game, and the License covers their use to the same extent as the Game, including any and all applicable limitations. In-Game Items being offered or sold for one Gaijin’s Game are not compatible with any other game unless otherwise expressly facilitated and permitted by Gaijin.

6.2. The In-Game Items made available through the Gaijin services are licensed, not sold. The method and usage of the specific In-Game Items may depend on certain game mechanics and/or gameplay purposes.

6.3. Any fees (whether in the form of In-Game currency or “real world” money) paid by you in exchange for any In-Game Items are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for another In-Game Item unless:
	* such refund or exchange is explicitly and unambiguously consented to by Gaijin (for example, you can trade virtual currency for another In-Game Item strictly to the extent expressly allowed in the applicable Game);
	* otherwise is provided by the Terms of Service;
	* otherwise provided by applicable law as a mandatory rule.

PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT GAIJIN DOES NOT MAKE ANY REFUNDS IN CASE OF, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR GAIJIN ACCOUNT DELETION OR ITS OTHER EXPIRATION, LICENSE REVOCATION, OR OTHER EULA TERMINATION ON ANY GROUNDS.

6.4. Please also see our Terms of Service for more details on charging and billing any applicable fees made within Gaijin services (including store and marketplace for which we may invoke the additional rules being a part of the Terms and Conditions), including our Games. Please pay special attention to Sections 5 and 6 thereof.

7. AGE RESTRICTIONS

7.1. Besides the minimum age necessary to accept the Terms and Conditions (including this EULA) as stipulated by the Terms and Conditions (16 years old or other age of necessary legal capacity in your country), please take into consideration that each Game also has its age rating or limitations (e.g., PEGI, ESRB depending on your region).

	* Refrain from using our Games;
	* Consult your parents or legal guardian whether you can play the Game;
	* Do other actions as required by the laws of your country.

If you tend to such diseases, we strongly recommend consulting your doctor before playing our Games or refusing to play; Gaijin is not responsible for any direct or indirect consequences of playing a Game in such a situation.

You also acknowledge that continuous playing can lead to excessive fatigue that can provoke certain diseases, including impaired vision, various forms of spinal deformities, neuroses, and other health disorders. You are independently responsible for keeping track of the time spent while playing our Games, organizing breaks/rest, taking proper position while playing, and undertaking other precautions to keep your health safe.

9. SYSTEM AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Please note that the requirements mentioned below may periodically change, including with respect to the same Game. It is mostly connected with the changes to the Game being made by Gaijin from time to time, according to Section 10 of this EULA. Nevertheless, Gaijin also reserves the right to change such requirements in respect of any Games at its sole discretion.

9.1.1. Minimum requirements. Each Game is designed to be run on one or several specific platforms (operating systems or devices). In some cases, a Game may have its minimum technical requirements for your device (e.g., in terms of CPU, GPU, RAM, free storage, etc.), which are indicated by Gaijin on the Game’s official website, Game’s official page on a third party gaming platform or by other means at Gaijin’s discretion. Please ensure your platform meets such a minimum. Otherwise, Gaijin does not guarantee the Game’s launch or functioning and is not responsible for other flaws in the Game’s work. You are solely responsible for having sufficient device resources to store and launch the Game, including free RAM, storage, CPU and GPU load, etc.

9.1.2. Recommended requirements. For informational purposes and your convenience, we usually publish our Games' recommended requirements concerning your device's technical parameters. Please pay attention that such recommended requirements are designed for information purposes only and do not guarantee flawless functioning of the Game nor imply any other guarantee or warranty. For the avoidance of doubt, if a platform (whether device or operating system) is stated as a “recommended requirement” for a Game, it means the Game is designed to operate solely on such a platform. The same applies to other “recommended requirements,” which are clear to be necessary from the context.

9.1.3. Internet connection requirement. Usually, Gaijin’s Games require a stable high-speed Internet connection to work correctly and provide a good gaming experience. Please consider that Gaijin is not responsible for any flaws in Game work arising from the quality (including speed, reachability of Gaijin servers and response time, or so-called “ping”) of your Internet connection.

10. PATCHES, UPDATES, AND MODIFICATIONS

10.1. To ensure the best level of services, user experience, and Gaijin services efficiency within the Games, we need to patch, update, and modify our Games from time to time. That usually results in mandatory and/or automatic updates of our Games, and the older versions may not launch or operate until you update them.

10.2. Gaijin has the right to change the software code of the Game at any time at its sole discretion. Such changes may affect, among others, the functionality of the Game and its other content. For instance, we can add or remove Game content or features, fix bugs and errors, make balance changes, etc.

10.3. Please pay special attention that some patches, updates, and modifications may require (and over time will require) higher technical requirements to your device, or increase the device resources consumption by the Game, otherwise they may lead (and over time will lead) to performance drop of the Game and/or lower graphics or other settings.

10.4. By accepting this EULA, you confirm and acknowledge that your refusal to update the Game may make its further use by you impossible, and this EULA shall be deemed suspended until you update the Game.
